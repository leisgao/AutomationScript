let question = In the $xy$â€‘plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. What is the center of the circle?
let choices = \Tuple {-3,2}, \Tuple {-2,3}, \Tuple {2,-3}, \Tuple {3,-2}
let answer = B
let solution = To find the center of the circle, we can complete the squares in the given equation. \par \begin {align*} x^2 + 4x + y^2 - 6y - 3 &= 0 \\ \left (x^2+4x+4\right )+\left (y^2-6y+9\right ) &= 3+4+9 \\ (x+2)^2+(y-3)^2 &= 16 \\ \end {align*} \par The center is thus~\Tuple {-2,3}.
