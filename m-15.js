let question = If~$y^{\frac {2}{3}} = x^{\frac {7}{2}}$, where $x>0$ and~$y>0$, what is $y^{\frac {1}{6}}$ in terms of~$x$?
let choices = x^{\frac {7}{8}}, \frac {1}{4} x^{\frac {7}{2}}, x^{\frac {7}{2}} - x^{\frac {21}{8}}, x^{14}
let answer = A
let solution = Raise both sides of the equation to the power~$\frac {3}{2}$ to solve for~$y$: \par \begin {align*} y^{\frac {2}{3}} &= x^{\frac {7}{2}} \\ \left (y^{\frac {2}{3}}\right )^{\frac {3}{2}} &= \left (x^{\frac {7}{2}}\right )^{\frac {3}{2}} \\ y &= x^{\frac {7}{2} \cdot \frac {3}{2}} \\ y &= x^{\frac {21}{4}} \\ \end {align*} \par We want to find the value of~$y^{\frac {1}{6}}$, so raise both sides of this equation to the power~$\frac {1}{6}$: \par \[ y^{\frac {1}{6}} = \left (x^{\frac {21}{4}}\right )^{\frac {1}{6}} = x^{\frac {21}{4}\cdot \frac {1}{6}} = x^{\frac {7}{8}} \] \par Alternatively, raising both sides of the original equation to the power~$\frac {1}{4}$ will yield the result directly. (Student who are aware of and understand such an approach typically do not have difficulties with this question.)
