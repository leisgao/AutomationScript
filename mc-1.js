let question = If~$12-2x=4$, what is the value of~$4x$?
let choices = 2,4,8,16
let answer = D
let solution = If~$12-2x=4$, then~$2x=12-4=8$. From here, we have two approaches. \par \begin {enumerate} \item We can solve for~$x$ to get~$x=4$, and plug this value into~$4x$ to get~16. \item We can multiply both sides of the equation~$2x=8$ by~2 to get~$4x=16$. \end {enumerate} \par Either way, choice~\TextChoice {4} is correct.
