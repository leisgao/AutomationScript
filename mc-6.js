let solution = To solve the given equation, we must get rid of the square root. Square both sides of the equation and collect like terms to get a quadratic equation as shown below. \par \begin {align*} \sqrt {7-2x} &= x-2 \\ 7-2x &= (x-2)^2 \\ 7-2x &= x^2-4x+4 \\ 0 &= x^2-2x-3 \\ 0 &= (x+1)(x-3) \\ \end {align*} \par The solutions to this quadratic are $-1$ and~3, but we must verify that these are solutions to the original equation. \par If we plug in $-1$ for~$x$, we get $\sqrt {7-2(-1)}=-1-2$. This equation is equivalent to~$\sqrt {9}=-3$, which is clearly incorrect. \par If we plug in 3 for~$x$, we get $\sqrt {7-2(3)}=3-2$. This equation is equivalent to~$\sqrt {1}=1$, which is correct. \par The only solution to this equation is~$3$, so choice~\TextChoice {1} is correct.
