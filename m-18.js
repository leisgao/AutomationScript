let question = In the equation above, $a$ is a constant, and both 17~and~91 are solutions to the equation. What is the value of~$a$?
let choices = null
let answer = 54
let solution = If 17 is a solution to the equation, then~$\left |17-a\right |=37$, so~$17-a = \pm 37$. The two possible values of~$a$ are $-20$ and~54. \par At this point, since we cannot enter negative numbers on the answer sheet, we know that~$a=54$. We present a more mathematical approach for completeness. \par Now use the second solution,~91, the same way we used~17 above. If 91 is a solution, then~$\left |91-a\right |=37$, so~$91-a = \pm 37$. The two values of~$a$ are 54 and~128. The only common value of~$a$ when using the two solutions is~54, so it must be correct. \par Alternatively, this equation tells us that both 17 and~91 are 37~away from~$a$, so $a$ is equal to the average of these two values. Since~$\frac {17+91}{2}=54$, the correct answer is~54.
