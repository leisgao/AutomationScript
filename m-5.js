let question = In the equation above, $a$ is a constant, and 5~is a solution to the equation. What is the other solution to the equation?
let choices = -5,-3,1,3
let answer = B
let solution = Since the question states that 5 is a solution to the equation, we can plug in 5 for~$x$ and solve for~$a$: \par \begin {align*} ax(x-2) &= 45 \\ 5a(5-2) &= 45 \\ 15a &= 45 \\ a &= 3 \\ \end {align*} \par Since~$a=3$, the equation is~$3x(x-2)=45$. The question is asking for the other solution of the equation, not the value of~$a$, so we solve the equation for~$x$: \par \begin {align*} 3x(x-2) &= 45 \\ x(x-2) &= 15 \\ x^2-2x-15 &= 0 \\ (x-5)(x+3) &= 0 \\ \end {align*} \par In the last step above, remember that 5 is already a known solution to the equation. Use this information to help factor more quickly. We now see that the other solution to the equation is~$-3$.
