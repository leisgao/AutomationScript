let question = A geologist determines that the current width of a fault is 47.23~centimeters and estimates that the width of the fault will increase by 6.4~centimeters every 10~years. Which of the following equations best represents the estimated width of the fault~$w$, in centimeters, after $t$~years?
let choices = 47.23+0.64t, 47.23+64t, (6.4)47.23+10t, 47.23t+64
let answer = A
let solution = The current width of the fault is 47.23~centimeters. Every 10~years, this width increases by 6.4~centimeters, so every year, this width increases by $\frac {6.4}{10}=0.64$~centimeters. Thus, after $t$~years, the width has increased by $0.64t$~centimeters from the original value of 47.23~centimeters. Therefore, the width after $t$~years can be expressed as~$47.23+0.64t$, so choice~\TextChoice {1} is correct.
