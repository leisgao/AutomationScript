let question = If~$\frac {2x+5y}{2y}=8$, what is the value of~$\frac {x}{2y}$?
let choices = \frac {11}{8}, \frac {11}{4}, \frac {11}{2}, 6
let answer = B
let solution = There is not much we can do with the right-hand side of the equation, so focus on the left-hand side. We can split the numerator of the fraction and move the resulting constants to the right-hand side. \par \begin {align*} \frac {2x+5y}{2y} &= 8 \\[2ex] \frac {2x}{2y}+\frac {5y}{2y} &= 8 \\[2ex] \frac {x}{y}+\frac {5}{2} &= 8 \\[2ex] \frac {x}{y} &= \frac {11}{2} \\ \end {align*} \par Since~$\frac {x}{y}=\frac {11}{2}$, we can divide both sides by~2 to get~$\frac {x}{2y}=\frac {11}{4}$.
