let question = When a light bulb is first turned on, its brightness is 450~lumens. The brightness increases at a constant rate of 20~lumens per second until the light bulb reaches its maximum brightness of 950~lumens 25~seconds later. Which of the following functions best represents the brightness of the light bulb~$b(s)$, in lumens, $s$~seconds after the light bulb is first turned on, for~$0 \leq s \leq 25$?
let choices = 450+20s, 450+25s, 950+20s, 950+25s
let answer = A
let solution = When~$s=0$, the brightness is 450~lumens. The brightness increases by 20~lumens each second. Thus, after $s$~seconds, the brightness is $450+20s$~lumens. Therefore, choice~\TextChoice {1} is correct.
