let question = In the $xy$â€‘plane, the graph of~$y=x^2+5x+b$ is the image of the graph of~$y=x^2+5x-3$ after a translation of 12~units up, where $b$ is a constant. What is the value of~$b$?
let choices = null
let answer = 9
let solution = If the graph of~$y=x^2+5x-3$ is translated 12~units up, we end up with the graph of~$y=x^2+5x-3+12$. Since this equation is equivalent to~$y=x^2+5x+9$, we conclude that~$b=9$.
