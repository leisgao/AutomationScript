let question = A food-supply company fills aluminum cans with 12~ounces of a beverage. How many of these cans can be filled with 60~\uline {gallons} of the beverage? ($\Si {1}{gallon}=\Si {128}{ounces}$)
let choices = 640,720,1280,1536
let answer = A
let solution = Since 60~gallons is equivalent to $128(60)=\num {7680}$~ounces and each can requires 12~ounces of the beverage, a total of $\frac {\num {7680}}{12} = 640$~cans can be filled.
