let question = A university had 37~graduate students in a program when it began to expand the program. In each of the first 8~semesters after the start of expansion, 6~new graduate students enrolled in the program, and 2~graduate students finished the program. During these 8~semesters, which of the following equations best models the number of graduate students~$g$ in the program $s$~semesters after the university started expanding the program?
let choices = -2s+37, 3s+37, 4s+37, 6s+37
let answer = C
let solution = Each semester, there are 6~new graduate students, and 2~graduate students leave, for a net increase of 4~graduate students. Thus, $s$~semesters after the university started expanding the program, the number of graduate students had increased by~$4s$. Since there were 37~graduate students initially, we get the equation~$g=4s+37$. Choice~\TextChoice {3} is correct.
