let question = Alvin starts reading a 325â€‘page book and reads 4\% of the pages in the book each day until he has read all 325~pages. How many pages has Alvin read after 6~days?
let choices = 24,40,54,78
let answer = D
let solution = Alvin reads 4\% of the pages each day. Since there are 325~pages in the book, 4\% of the pages is~13. Thus, after 6~days, he has read $6(13)=78$~pages.
