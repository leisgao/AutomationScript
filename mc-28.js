let question = Which of the following could be an equation of the circle in the $xy$‑plane above?
let choices = (x - 4)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 9, (x - 4)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 16, (x - 4)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 25, (x + 4)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 16
let answer = C
let solution = From the graph, we see that the center of the circle is at~\Tuple {4,3}. We can also see from the graph that the diameter of the circle is~10, so the radius is~5. Thus, an equation of this circle is~$(x-4)^2+(x-3)^2=25$, so choice~\TextChoice {3} is correct. \par Choices \TextChoice {1} and~\TextChoice {2} are the result of incorrectly determining the radius using the distance between the $x$‑intercepts and the distance between the $y$‑intercepts as the diameter. Choice~\TextChoice {4} also incorrectly determines the radius, but the center is more obviously incorrect.
