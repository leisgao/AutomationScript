let question = For a positive real number~$a$, where~$a^3 = 3$, what is the value of~$a^9 + a^6$?
let choices = 15,36,45,756
let answer = B
let solution = If~$a^3=3$, then we can square and cube this equation to find the values of $a^6$ and~$a^9$: \par \begin {align*} a^6 &= \left (a^3\right )^2 = 3^2 = 9 \\ a^9 &= \left (a^3\right )^3 = 3^3 = 27 \\ \end {align*} \par Thus,~$a^9+a^6=27+9=36$, so choice~\TextChoice {2} is correct.
