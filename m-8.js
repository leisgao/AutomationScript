let question = Which of the following could be an equation of the graph shown in the $xy$‑plane above?
let choices = -\frac {2}{3}x + 5, -\frac {2}{3}x + \frac {15}{2}, \frac {2}{3}x + 5, \frac {2}{3}x + \frac {15}{2}
let answer = A
let solution = From the graph, we can immediately tell two pieces of information: the slope is negative and the $y$‑intercept is~\Tuple {0,5}. (We can calculate the slope and find that it is equal to~$-\frac {2}{3}$, but that step is not necessary. The two slopes in the answer choices are $-\frac {2}{3}$ and~$\frac {2}{3}$, so knowing that the slope is negative is enough.) The answer choice with negative slope and the correct $y$‑intercept is choice~\TextChoice {1}.
