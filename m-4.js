let question = The equation above approximates the exchange rate between $a$~Australian dollars and $u$~United States dollars on a particular day. What is $u$ in terms of~$a$?
let choices = a + 0.76, a - 0.76, 0.76a, \frac {a}{0.76}
let answer = D
let solution = We are given that~$a=0.76u$. To solve for~$u$, divide both sides by~0.76 to get~$u=\frac {a}{0.76}$. Choice~\TextChoice {4} is correct.
let diagram = $a = 0.76u$
