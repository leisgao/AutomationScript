let question = It takes Earth \num {8766}~hours to complete one orbit. Based on the given equation, what is the mean orbital speed of Earth, to the nearest mile per \uline {minute}?
let choices = null
let answer = 1110
let solution = We are given the greatest distance between Earth and the Sun and the time it takes to complete one orbit, so we can plug the values into the given equation: \par \begin {align*} v &= \frac {2\pi d}{T} \\[2ex] v &= \frac {2\pi (\Si {92950000}{miles})}{\Si {8766}{hours}} \\ v &\approx \Si {66623.55}{miles per hour} \\ \end {align*} \par To find the mean orbital speed in miles per \emph {minute}, we divide this result by~60: \par \[ \Si {66623.55}{miles per hour} \cdot \frac {\Si {1}{hour}}{\Si {60}{minutes}} \approx \Si {1110.39}{miles per minute} \] \par The the nearest kilometer per minute, the result is~\num {1110}. (Student who use the value~3.14 as an estimate for~$\pi $ will get a speed of approximately \Si {1109.83}~miles per hour, which yields the same answer to the nearest mile per hour.)
