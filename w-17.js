let question = At this point, the writer is considering adding the following sentence. \begin {quote} In some of the non-predator areas, the number of foxes was low because of fox hunting, which is legal in some areas of the Netherlands. \end {quote} Should the writer make this addition here?
let choices = ['Yes, because it helps to clarify why mice have fewer predators in some places than they do in others.', 'Yes, because it emphasizes that increases in Lyme disease have been caused by human indifference.', 'No, because the information fails to account for the roles of other factors in the lower number of foxes.', 'No, because it provides a detail that is not necessary for an understanding of ticks’ role in the transmission of Lyme disease.']
let answer = D
let solution = Choice~\TextChoice {4} is correct. The paragraph introduces Hofmeester’s findings regarding the relationship between the number of predators and the numbers of both ticks in general and infected ticks. Why there are fewer foxes in a region is not directly relevant to the issue of the numbers mentioned in the previous sentence. Note that the reasons in choices \TextChoice {1} and~\TextChoice {3} are true, but neither reason justifies the conclusion. In other words, in choice~\TextChoice {1}, it is true that the issue of fox hunting helps to clarify why mice have fewer predators in some places, but that information is not necessary or even helpful for the paragraph’s main point, so the true reason is not a valid justification. In choice~\TextChoice {3}, we have a similar situation. It is true that the sentence does not account for other factors related to relative numbers of foxes, but the point is that the reasons are not important, so adding additional factors would not be helpful.
