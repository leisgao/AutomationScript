let solution = In \reflines {TheirFormation}, the author quotes Day as saying, “Their study says that all of the glass bead deposits on the lunar surface are ‘wet,’ which is a great observation. However, they cannot elucidate the mechanism of their formation.” This quotation makes choice~\TextChoice {1} correct. \par Choice~\TextChoice {2} is incorrect because Day seems to accept some of Milliken’s results, in particular, that glass beads are wet: “Their study says that all of the glass bead deposits on the lunar surface are ‘wet,’ which is a great observation” (\reflines {TheirObservation}). \par Choice~\TextChoice {3} is incorrect because calling Milliken’s research “thoroughly irresponsible” is far too harsh. Day seems to accept Milliken’s research as accurate, though Day disputes the conclusion. But even if Day disagreed with everything Milliken did and concluded, we would need strong evidence to justify “thoroughly irresponsible.” Moreover, there \emph {is} evidentiary support for Milliken’s conclusion. The beads provide such evidence. \par Choice~\TextChoice {4} is incorrect. Whether Milliken considered volatile elements is not clear from the passage, and it’s not even clear whether he should have. More importantly the passage does not indicate that Day believes Milliken failed to consider volatile elements. The discussion of such elements is restricted to the portion of the passage explaining Day’s findings. Since Day and Milliken looked at different things, we cannot conclude that Milliken should have considered the same things Day did.
