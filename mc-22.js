let question = In the system of equations above, $a$~is a constant. For what value of~$a$ will there be infinitely many solutions to the system?
let choices = -9,-3,1,3
let answer = A
let solution = If the system has infinitely many solutions, then the two equations in the system are constant multiples of each other. The $x$‑ and $y$‑coefficients in the second equation are 3~times the corresponding coefficients in the first equation, so the constant,~$a$, in the second equation must be 3~times the constant in the first equation. Since the constant in the first equation is~$-3$, the value of~$a$ is~$3(-3)=-9$.
