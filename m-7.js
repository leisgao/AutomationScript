let question = The system of equations above is graphed in the $xy$â€‘plane. If one of the intersection points of the graphs is~\Tuple {4,0} and the other intersection point is~\Tuple {x,y}, what is the value of~$x$?
let choices = -4,-3,-2,-1
let answer = D
let solution = To find the other point of intersection, we can set the right-hand sides of the equations equal to each other and solve for~$x$: \par \begin {align*} (x-4)(x+2) &= x-4 \\ x^2-2x-8 &= x-4 \\ x^2-3x-4 &= 0 \\ (x-4)(x+1) &= 0 \\ \end {align*} \par We know the solution~$x=4$ corresponds to the point of intersection given in the question:~\Tuple {4,0}. The other solution,~$x=-1$, corresponds to the other point of intersection. Choice~\TextChoice {4} is thus correct.
let diagram = $\begin {aligned} y &= (x-4)(x+2) \\ y &= x-4 \\ \end {aligned}$
