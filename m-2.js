let question = A popcorn stand at a county fair sold $r$~bags of regular popcorn for 5~dollars each and $c$~bags of caramel popcorn for 7~dollars each. If the stand sold 272~bags of regular and caramel popcorn for a total of \num {1788}~dollars, which of the following systems of equations best represents this situation?
let choices = ['$\\begin {aligned} r + c &= 272 \\\\ 5r + 7c &= \\num {1788} \\\\ \\end {aligned}$', '$\\begin {aligned} r + c &= 272 \\\\ 7r + 5c &= \\num {1788} \\\\ \\end {aligned}$', '$\\begin {aligned} r + c &= \\num {1788} \\\\ 5r + 7c &= 272 \\\\ \\end {aligned}$', '$\\begin {aligned} r + 5c &= 272 \\\\ r + 7c &= \\num {1788} \\\\ \\end {aligned}$']
let answer = A
let solution = The total number of bags of regular and caramel popcorn sold was~272, so~$r+c=272$. The bags of regular popcorn were sold for 5~dollars each, so the $r$~bags of regular popcorn were sold for a total of $5r$~dollars. The bags of caramel popcorn were sold for 7~dollars each, so the $c$~bags of caramel popcorn were sold for a total of $7c$~dollars. Since the bags of regular and caramel popcorn were sold for a total of \num {1788}~dollars, we know that $5r+7c=\num {1788}$. These two equations are given in choice~\TextChoice {1}.
