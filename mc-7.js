let question = How much less energy, in joules, is used by the new refrigerator than the old refrigerator in one \uline {minute}?
let choices = 5520,6480,7560,14040
let answer = B
let solution = The power consumption of the old refrigerator is 234~joules per second, and the power consumption of the new refrigerator is 126~joules per second, so the power consumption of the new refrigerator is $234-126=108$~joules per second less than the power consumption of the old refrigerator. At a rate of 108~joules per second, the total difference in the energy used in one \emph {minute} is $60(108)=\num {6480}$~joules. Choice~\TextChoice {2} is correct.
