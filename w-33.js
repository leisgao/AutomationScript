let question = The writer wants to revise the underlined portion so that the concluding sentence summarizes the main ideas of the passage. Which choice best accomplishes this goal?
let choices = ['replied, an answer that suggests that Picasso must have misunderstood the German officer’s meaning.', 'replied, though whether such a conversation actually took place remains uncertain today.', 'replied, emphasizing that \\emph {Guernica} the painting merely commemorated a horrific event in Guernica the town.', 'replied, but the style of \\emph {Guernica} made it clear that Picasso probably was the artist who painted it.']
let answer = C
let solution = The passage begins with a description of the Nazi bombing of Guernica before indicating that Picasso (eventually) decided to paint \emph {Guernica} “to respond to the atrocity.” The painting is referred to “one of the most powerful anti-war paintings in history” in the second paragraph, and the third paragraph describes some of the features of the painting. \par Choice~\TextChoice {3} is correct. It correctly interprets Picasso’s alleged response and captures that meaning in a way that reinforces the main ideas in the passage. \par Choice~\TextChoice {1} is incorrect. Even if we accept that Picasso misunderstood the German officer, this answer choice does not summarize the main ideas of the passage. \par Choice~\TextChoice {2} is incorrect. The passage certainly suggests that the conversation may not have taken place, but that point is not one of the “main ideas” of the passage. \par Choice~\TextChoice {4} is incorrect. The passage is about Picasso’s response to the bombing of a town, not about issues of the true authorship of \emph {Guernica}. \par It is worth noting that various sources report the alleged exchange as fact, but the two comments rely on the ambiguity of an English word. A German officer in Nazi-occupied France and Picasso would have been unlikely to converse in English.
