let question = If \Tuple {3,y} is a solution to the system of equations above and $a$ is a constant, what is the value of~$a$?
let choices = 2,3,4,5
let answer = A
let solution = We are given that \Tuple {3,y} is a solution to the system of equations, so we can plug in 3 for~$x$: \par \begin {align*} 9-2y &= 1 \\ -3+ay &= 5 \\ \end {align*} \par The first equation is easily solved to get~$y=4$. Plug this value into the second equation to get~$-3+4a=5$. Solve for~$a$ to get~$a=\frac {8}{4}=2$.
