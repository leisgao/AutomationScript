let question = The function~$f$ is defined above. If~$f(-2a)=0$, where $a$ is a constant, what is one possible value of~$a$?
let choices = null
let answer = 1; $\frac {5}{2}$; 2.5
let solution = If~$f(-2a)=0$, then we plug $-2a$ into the definition of~$f$ for~$x$ and solve for~$a$: \par \begin {align*} f(-2a) &= 0 \\ (-2a+2)^2(-2a+5) &= 0 \\ \end {align*} \par Given the form of this equation, we know that either $-2a+2=0$ or~$-2a+5=0$. Solve these two equations to get $a=1$ or~$a=\frac {5}{2}$.
