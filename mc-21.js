let question = If $f$~is a polynomial and the roots of~$f$ are $-3$, 1, and~3, which of the following could be~$f(x)$?
let choices = (x-3)^2 + (x-1) + (x+3)^2, (x-3)^2(x+1)(x+3)^2, (x^2-3)(x-1), (x^2-9)(x-1)^2
let answer = D
let solution = If the roots of~$f$ are $-3$, 1, and~3, then $x+3$, $x-1$, and~$x-3$ must be factors of~$f$. In choice~\TextChoice {4}, we can factor $x^2-9$ as~$(x-3)(x+3)$, yielding~$f(x)=(x-3)(x+3)(x-1)^2$, which has the correct factors. Choice~\TextChoice {4} is correct. \par Choice~\TextChoice {1} is incorrect because the roots are not equal to those given in the question. For example, $f(1)=(1-3)^2+(1-1)+(1+3)^2=20$, so 1 is not a root. \par The roots of choice~\TextChoice {2} are $-3$, $-1$, and~3, so the root of~1 is missing. \par The roots of choice~\TextChoice {3} are $\pm \sqrt {3}$ and~1, so the roots of $-3$ and~3 are missing.
