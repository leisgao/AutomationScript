let question = The manager at a movie theater uses the model above to predict the total amount~$r$, in dollars, of refreshment sales based on the total amount~$t$, in dollars, of ticket sales, where $c$ is a constant. If the manager predicts the total refreshment sales will be \num {13000}~dollars when the total amount of ticket sales is \num {54000}~dollars, what is the value of~$c$?
let choices = \frac {5}{3},2,3,\frac {53}{12}
let answer = B
let solution = The question gives use the following values: \par \begin {align*} r &= \num {13000} \\ t &= \num {54000} \\ \end {align*} \par We are asked to find the value of~$c$, so we plug the preceding values into the given equation and solve for~$c$: \par \begin {align*} \frac {ct+\num {9000}}{9} &= r \\[2ex] \frac {\num {54000}c+\num {9000}}{9} &= \num {13000} \\[2ex] \num {54000}c+\num {9000} &= \num {117000} \\ \num {54000}c &= \num {108000} \\ c &= \frac {\num {108000}}{\num {54000}} \\[2ex] c &= 2 \end {align*}
